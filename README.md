# Responsive cocktail website with ligth-, dark- and accessible-theme

This project showcases a modern cocktail website that is fully responsive and supports three themes: Light, Dark, and Accessible (for visually impaired users). The design emphasizes readability, usability, and smooth UI transitions.

---

## Desktop First Layout

The website is built desktop-first, meaning the design and layout are optimized for larger screens first and then adapted to tablets and mobile devices.

## Header & Navigation

A fixed header with a logo and navigation links (Home, Favorites, Signature Drinks, Shop, Recipes, Contact Us).

Includes a theme toggle button to switch between **light**, **dark**, and **accessible** themes.

Sign-in / Sign-up buttons dynamically adjust depending on the user authentication state.

## Themes

The website supports three themes using CSS custom properties (--variable-name) and dynamic class toggling on the body element:

### Light Theme

<img width="1919" height="847" alt="website_light" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd1d2fd-7d58-4c42-8239-4f4d4d781c76" />

- Default theme with soft ruby colors and a modern pastel palette.

- Optimized for normal readability and aesthetic visuals.

- Example colors:

```css
 --body-color: hsl(10, 30%, 85%), --card-bg: hsl(350, 75%, 30%)
 ```

### Dark Theme

<img width="1919" height="849" alt="website_dark" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92173148-7f8a-41cc-bfed-15906228e4af" />

- Designed for low-light conditions to reduce eye strain.

- Dark ruby backgrounds with brighter text for better contrast.

- Adjusted box shadows and text colors for visibility.

- Example colors: --body-color: #342121, --card-bg: hsl(350, 80%, 20%).

### Accessible Theme

<img width="1917" height="832" alt="website_acc" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ca7bf0-3e8e-4449-bfd3-1c6cc8018a10" />

- For visually impaired users, larger font sizes and high contrast.

- Uses bright accents and clearly readable typography.

- Adjusted inputs, buttons, and modal containers to match accessible color standards.

- Example colors: --body-color: #2e2525, --card-bg: #371d1d, --accent-color: #00ffff.

- Font sizes are scaled up: --biggest-font-size: 3.5rem, --h1-font-size: 1.75rem.

## For tablet and mobile users (< 756px)

- Navigation transforms into a slide-out menu.

- Hamburger toggle button appears for opening/closing the menu.

- Theme toggle and sign-in/sign-up icons repositioned for usability.
